      "{'problem': 'Polycarp has $n$ different binary words. A word called binary if it contains only characters \\'0\\' and \\'1\\'. For example, these words are binary: \"0001\", \"11\", \"0\" and \"0011100\".\\n\\nPolycarp wants to offer his set of $n$ binary words to play a game \"words\". In this game, players name words and each next word (starting from the second) must start with the last character of the previous word. The first word can be any. For example, these sequence of words can be named during the game: \"0101\", \"1\", \"10\", \"00\", \"00001\".\\n\\nWord reversal is the operation of reversing the order of the characters. For example, the word \"0111\" after the reversal becomes \"1110\", the word \"11010\" after the reversal becomes \"01011\".\\n\\nProbably, Polycarp has such a set of words that there is no way to put them in the order correspondent to the game rules. In this situation, he wants to reverse some words from his set so that:  the final set of $n$ words still contains different words (i.e. all words are unique);  there is a way to put all words of the final set of words in the order so that the final sequence of $n$ words is consistent with the game rules. \\n\\nPolycarp wants to reverse minimal number of words. Please, help him.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$) — the number of test cases in the input. Then $t$ test cases follow.\\n\\nThe first line of a test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2\\\\cdot10^5$) — the number of words in the Polycarp\\'s set. Next $n$ lines contain these words. All of $n$ words aren\\'t empty and contains only characters \\'0\\' and \\'1\\'. The sum of word lengths doesn\\'t exceed $4\\\\cdot10^6$. All words are different.\\n\\nGuaranteed, that the sum of $n$ for all test cases in the input doesn\\'t exceed $2\\\\cdot10^5$. Also, guaranteed that the sum of word lengths for all test cases in the input doesn\\'t exceed $4\\\\cdot10^6$.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nPrint answer for all of $t$ test cases in the order they appear.\\n\\nIf there is no answer for the test case, print -1. Otherwise, the first line of the output should contain $k$ ($0 \\\\le k \\\\le n$) — the minimal number of words in the set which should be reversed. The second line of the output should contain $k$ distinct integers — the indexes of the words in the set which should be reversed. Words are numerated from $1$ to $n$ in the order they appear. If $k=0$ you can skip this line (or you can print an empty line). If there are many answers you can print any of them.\\n\\n\\n-----Example-----\\nInput\\n4\\n4\\n0001\\n1000\\n0011\\n0111\\n3\\n010\\n101\\n0\\n2\\n00000\\n00001\\n4\\n01\\n001\\n0001\\n00001\\n\\nOutput\\n1\\n3 \\n-1\\n0\\n\\n2\\n1 2', 'solutions': '[\"for _ in range(int(input())):\\\\n    n = int(input())\\\\n    mass = []\\\\n    zo = 0\\\\n    oz = 0\\\\n    zz = 0\\\\n    oo = 0\\\\n    ozs = []\\\\n    zos = []\\\\n    ozss = set()\\\\n    zoss = set()\\\\n    for j in range(n):\\\\n        k = input()\\\\n        mass.append(k)\\\\n        if k[0] == \\'0\\' and k[-1] == \\'1\\':\\\\n            zoss.add(k)\\\\n            zos.append(j + 1)\\\\n            zo += 1\\\\n        elif k[0] == \\'1\\' and k[-1] == \\'0\\':\\\\n            ozss.add(k)\\\\n            ozs.append(j + 1)\\\\n            oz += 1\\\\n        elif k[0] == \\'0\\' and k[-1] == \\'0\\':\\\\n            zz += 1\\\\n        else:\\\\n            oo += 1\\\\n    if zz and oo and not oz and not zo:\\\\n        print(-1)\\\\n        continue\\\\n    else:\\\\n        if zo > oz:\\\\n            print((zo -

      "{'problem': \"An accordion is a string (yes, in the real world accordions are musical instruments, but let's forget about it for a while) which can be represented as a concatenation of: an opening bracket (ASCII code $091$), a colon (ASCII code $058$), some (possibly zero) vertical line characters (ASCII code $124$), another colon, and a closing bracket (ASCII code $093$). The length of the accordion is the number of characters in it.\\n\\nFor example, [::], [:||:] and [:|||:] are accordions having length $4$, $6$ and $7$. (:|:), {:||:}, [:], ]:||:[ are not accordions. \\n\\nYou are given a string $s$. You want to transform it into an accordion by removing some (possibly zero) characters from it. Note that you may not insert new characters or reorder existing ones. Is it possible to obtain an accordion by removing characters from $s$, and if so, what is the maximum possible length of the result?\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe only line contains one string $s$ ($1 \\\\le |s| \\\\le 500000$). It consists of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nIf it is not possible to obtain an accordion by removing some characters from $s$, print $-1$. Otherwise print maximum possible length of the resulting accordion.\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n|[a:b:|]\\n\\nOutput\\n4\\n\\nInput\\n|]:[|:]\\n\\nOutput\\n-1\", 'solutions': '[\"s =
